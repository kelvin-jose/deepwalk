# DeepWalk - Graph Embedding and Node Classification

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for implementing the DeepWalk algorithm, a graph embedding technique, and using the resulting embeddings for node classification. DeepWalk is a method for learning latent representations of nodes in a graph by performing random walks on the graph and applying Word2Vec to learn node embeddings. These embeddings can then be used for various downstream tasks, such as node classification.

## deepwalk.py

### Introduction

The `deepwalk.py` file contains the implementation of the DeepWalk algorithm, which involves generating random walks on a given graph and training a Word2Vec model to learn embeddings for nodes.

### Class: `DeepWalk`

#### Methods

- `__init__(self, graph: Graph)`: Initializes the DeepWalk algorithm with a given graph.
- `random_walk(self, node: int, walk_length: int) -> List`: Performs a random walk starting from a given node.
- `generate_train_samples(self, num_samples: int, walk_length: int) -> List`: Generates training samples for the DeepWalk model.
- `train(self, X: List, embed_dim: int = 128, window: int = 5, min_count: int = 1, workers: int = 4) -> W2V`: Trains the DeepWalk model using the generated training samples.

## train.py

### Introduction

The `train.py` file demonstrates how to use the DeepWalk algorithm to generate node embeddings from a graph and provides an example using a dataset.

#### Steps

1. Load the necessary libraries and set constants and hyperparameters.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset (e.g., Cora dataset).
3. Generate training samples by applying DeepWalk to the graph.
4. Train a Word2Vec model using the generated training samples.
5. Visualize the embeddings using PCA.
6. Save the trained model.

## classifier.py

### Introduction

The `classifier.py` file showcases how to use the embeddings generated by DeepWalk for node classification. It provides an example of building a simple neural network classifier and training it on the embeddings.

#### Steps

1. Load the Word2Vec model trained using DeepWalk.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset (e.g., Cora dataset).
3. Create a neural network classifier and set hyperparameters.
4. Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. Initialize the neural network classifier and optimizer.
6. Train the classifier on the embeddings.
7. Plot the training and testing loss to visualize the training progress.
